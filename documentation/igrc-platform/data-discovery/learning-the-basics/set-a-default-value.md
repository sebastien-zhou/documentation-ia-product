This action allows you to set a value in an attribute if it is empty.     
The value can be a static or dynamic value (with syntax like macro {...}, illustrated in chapter 5.1).

**_Setting a default value for an empty attribute_**     

It is thus possible to associate a condition to the application of this action. Also, this action used consecutively on the same attribute, with the use of the conditional clause, allows (if, else if, else) type operations to be performed. We invite you to consult the "screencasts" on [http://expert-exchange.brainwavegrc.com](http://expert-exchange.brainwavegrc.com/) for a demonstration of this type of use.
