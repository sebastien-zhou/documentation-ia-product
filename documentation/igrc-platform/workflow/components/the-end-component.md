The End component indicates the end of the workflow process. This is a mandatory component and is automatically create for each new workflow.   

Its configuration is done in the three sub tabs of the properties tab (see caption below).    
The tabs include:   

- An Activity tab, which includes the display name. You can also chose the display method.
- A Description tab which can only include a description
- An Updates tab to configure which values, if necessary, are to update at the end of the process execution. Please refer to the page on [Start, End and manual activity composants description]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/igrc-platform/workflow/components/start-or-manual-activity-composants.md %}) for more information on the update configuration.
