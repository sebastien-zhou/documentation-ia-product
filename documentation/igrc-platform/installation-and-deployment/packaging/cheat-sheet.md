The following page provides you with high level information that can be useful when running the packaging, a cheat sheet of sorts.    

# Default credentials

Upon first login the default credentials are:  

- user/login: `setup`
- password: `Brainwave@2023`

# Hostname

The `hostname` **MUST** be *lowercase*.  

> The hostname configuration can be changed using the `brainwave config --hostname demo.local` command
> Change `demo.local` to match your environment's configuration

# TLS

To toggle `TLS`:  

- Enable: `brainwave config --tls`
- Disabled: `brainwave config --tls=false`

> The certificate names (in `/etc/brainwave` when in server mode) must match your **hostname**.  

# Local access and hosts file

If you are running a demonstration or sandbox environment, add the hostname you configured to the `/etc/hosts file`, for example:  

```bash  
127.0.0.1       demo.local
```

> Accessing the portal from that environment can be done using `http://demo.local` or `https://demo.local` depending on your `TLS` settings.  

# Data Location

Please use the following link for more information on the folders (paths) used by the packaging:

### Update / upgrade

To check for updates, run `brainwave status`.  
If an update is available it will show up in the console with a `!!` new to the `Latest available version`:  

```bash  
XXXX@XXXX:~$ brainwave status
Installation mode:         Server
Project name:              sandbox
Client version:            1.2.21
Installed version:         1.2.153
Latest available version:  1.2.183                   ‼
Registry:                  igrcanalytics.azurecr.io
Git configuration:         Valid                     √
Images:                    All present               √
Services                   Stopped                   ‼
```

To install the update, run `brainwave admin upgrade` for example:  

```bash  
XXXX@XXXX:~$ brainwave admin upgrade
  Finding latest 1.2 version
● Will upgrade to version 1.2.183

Proceed with upgrade [y/n]: y

√ Remove containers [Complete]
√ Run container bwresources [Complete]
√ Upgraded application to version 1.2.183
```

Then run `brainwave pull`.  

### Importfiles management

Source files are located here:

- `/var/lib/brainwave/sourcefiles`: files uploaded via the portal, or generated by connectors
- `/var/lib/brainwave/importfiles`: files from the `sourcefiles` folder are copied here and modified if needed for the data ingestion (timeslot)  

The `/var/lib/brainwave/importfiles` folder is mapped as a docker volume, `projectName_bwimportfiles`.  
This volume is mounted in the `bwbatch` container as `/data/importfiles`.  

> This is why in the `docker.configuration`, the `importfiles` variable points to `/data/importfiles`  
> It's content should be the same as `/var/lib/brainwave/importfiles`  

To use external data sources (not extracted via integrated connectors), you will need to use the [bw_data_collector.ps1]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/igrc-platform/installation-and-deployment/packaging/configuration/powershell-extraction.md %})
(configuration/powershell-extraction.md) script.  
You can configure it to upload each needed folder and files.  
After doing this you will need to create a `Generic bridge - file` datasource.  
This will simply copy the files that got uploaded to `/var/lib/brainwave/sourcefiles` into `/var/lib/brainwave/importfiles` where they will be ingested by your pre configured collects.  
Keep in my that you will not be able to use `{config.projectPath}/importfiles`, instead you should use a variable containing `/data/importfiles`.  

# CLI documentation generation

It is possible to generate the documentation of Brainwave CLI in Markdown format.  
To do so use the command `brainwave gendoc` :

```bash
PS ~> brainwave gendoc --help
Generate documentation

Usage:
  brainwave gendoc [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help            help for gendoc
  -o, --output string   Output directory (default "./doc")

Global Flags:
      --console-logs   Also show logs on the console
  -d, --debug count    Increase log level
      --no-color       Turn off colorization
  -q, --quiet count    Decrease log level
```

This provides you with the full list of available commands.
