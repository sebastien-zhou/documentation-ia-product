# Batch configuration and usage

## Batch script list  

Upon installation of Brainwave GRC a number of batch script files (`.cmd` files for a windows environment and `.sh` files for a linux environment) are included in the the iGRC analytics home folder:  

- `igrc_batch.cmd[cmd|sh]`: to execute the entire execution plan  
- `igrc_auditlog.cmd[cmd|sh]`: to execute the data loading of auditlogs  
- `igrc_extract.cmd[cmd|sh]`: to execute the extraction of data  
- `igrc_facetbuild.cmd[cmd|sh]`: to build a facet  
- `igrc_notify.cmd[cmd|sh]`: to launch a notification campaign  
- `igrc_purge.cmd[cmd|sh]`: to execute a purge of specified data  
- `igrc_sqlscript.cmd[cmd|sh]`: to export the necessary sql scripts to create or update iGRC database, create or update Activity database and export custom indexes creation script  
- `igrc_validate.cmd[cmd|sh]`: to validate an activated timeslot  
- `igrc_workflow.cmd[cmd|sh]`: to launch a workflow  
- `igrc_portal.cmd[cmd|sh]`: to export web portal  
- `igrc_project.cmd[cmd|sh]`: to export project  
- `igrc_archive.cmd[cmd|sh]`: to export project archive  

## Automatic data loading

For more information on how to configure Brainwave GRC to perform automatic data loading please use the following steps. These steps are given for a Windows environment, please adapt accordingly if you wish to use a Linux environment.

## Installation and planning

In order to access batch mode, iGRC Analytics must be installed on the computer. The home installation includes the `igrc_batch.cmd` script that runs all steps of the execution plan as configured in the technical configuration within the project. The executed steps are defined in the Execution plan tab:  

![Installation and planning](./images/batchEpConfiguration.png "Installation and planning")  

Once the execution plan is completed, the command `igrc_batch.[cmd|sh]` ends and returns control.

## Configuration

In order to run the execution plan via batch mode the following elements are required:  

- The project
- The data files (extracted from different repositories)
- A valid technical configuration defined in the project
- A valid license for product license

The project to be executed must be copied in the product installation directory workspace and the data files must be placed in the appropriate directory. The license file must be located in the configuration directory that will be used in the command line statement. It is therefore necessary to create a directory (for example: `c:\igrcanalytics\igrc_config`), where technical configuration files will be placed.

In the technical configuration of your project it is necessary to define the database to use in the Ledger base tab:

![Configuration](./images/batchBaseConfiguration.png "Configuration")

All parameters and elements configured in the technical configuration are automatically used when executing the execution plan in batch mode. It is nevertheless possible to use the legacy properties files to override the information provided by the technical configuration. To be taken into account when execution the batch command these `.properties` files must be place in the same folder as your valid license file. These files can automatically be created base on a technical configuration by using the export to properties functionality in the Variables tab of the technical configuration:  

![Configuration](./images/batchExportProperties.png "Configuration")  

> As the information present in the `.properties` files overwrites the values provided in the technical configuration the best practice is to use this methodology only for sensitive data, such as DB connection credentials or passwords.

See [here](./05-legacy-property-files.md) for more information on the `.properties` configuration.  

## Command line

The command line requires at least 3 parameters:  

- The project name: for example demo  
- The absolute path to the configuration directory. This directory MUST contain the license file and can contain `.properties` files to override the information provided in the technical configuration
- The name of the technical configuration to use  

As an example: `igrc_batch.cmd demo "c:\igrcanalytics\igrc_config" default`

> When running the batch command without any parameters defined a message is displayed providing information on how to use said command:
>
> ```bash
> "Expecting at least 3 parameters: <project name> <config directory path> <config name> [SIMULATE]. Aborting..."
> "usage: igrc_batch <project name> <config folder> <config name> [SIMULATE]"
> "<project name> is the project name"
> "<config directory path> can contain several of these files:"
> "       - project.properties: file containing project configuration variables"
> "       - datasource.properties: file containing database connection configuration"
> "       - mail.properties: file containing mail server connection configuration"
> "       - workflow.properties: file containing workflow database connection configuration"
> "       - license.lic: file containing the Brainwave product license"
> "<config name> is the name of the configuration (defined in a project .configuration file)"
> "[SIMULATE] simulation mode nothing will be written in Database"
> "Command line example: igrc_batch demonstration /var/igrc/config default SIMULATE"
> "Another example: igrc_batch demonstration /var/igrc/config default"
> ```

## Execution

The command `igrc_batch.cmd` goes through the following steps:

- Verification of the license and display of the key of no license is found.
- Launching the steps of the execution plan in accordance with the project settings
- Creation of a zip file containing all of the logs generated, and deletion of all the log files.
- **Optional**: Sending of a message to administrators, along with an attachment containing the zip file with the logs. This is defined in the Batch tab of the technical configuration

The zip file contains a file called `result-XXXXXXX.txt`, which gives the overall results of the operation, as well as any errors, if found.

> It is possible to remove the log files and/or the event files from the email sent to the administrators once the batch execution is terminated. Please see the Batch tab of the technical configuration for more information.  

## Sequencing the execution

Run the windows task scheduler and configure a batch execution task `igrc_batch` to the desired frequency.

## Batch commmands

When running the any of the following batch commands without any parameters defined a message is displayed providing information on how to use said command. This message includes the expected parameters and a brief description of each parameter.

### igrc_auditlog

This command allows you to run the execution plan for auditlogs via command line. The configuration is performed in the technical configuration of your project.  

```powershell  
"usage: igrc_auditlog <project name> <config folder> <config name>"
"<config folder> can contain several of these files:"
"- project.properties: file containing project configuration variables"
"- auditlog.properties: file containing database connection configuration"
"- mail.properties: file containing mail server connection configuration"
"- license.lic: file containing the Brainwave product license"
"<config name> is the name of the configuration (defined in a project .configuration file)"
"Command line example: igrc_auditlog demonstration /var/igrc/config default SIMULATE"
"Another example: igrc_auditlog demonstration /var/igrc/config default"
```

### igrc_batch

This command allows you to run the standard execution plan via command line. The configuration is performed in the technical configuration of your project. See [here](#batch-configuration-and-usage) for more information.  

```powershell  
"Expecting at least 3 parameters: <project name> <config directory path> <config name>
['SIMULATE' or 'FORCE'] [<reference timeslot tag>]. Aborting..."
```

As of version 2016 R3 it is possible to run the different independent silos in parallel. To do so, you have to add the following parameter, `-Dparallelsilos=true`, to the `JAVA_OPTS` of the `.cmd` or `.sh` file:  

```powershell  
"Expecting at least 3 parameters: <project name> <config directory path> <config name>. Aborting..."
"usage: igrc_batch <project name> <config folder> <config name> ['SIMULATE' or 'FORCE'] [<reference timeslot tag>]"
"<project name> is the project name"
"<config directory path> can contain several of these files:"
" - project.properties: file containing project configuration variables"
" - datasource.properties: file containing database connection configuration"
" - mail.properties: file containing mail server connection configuration"
" - workflow.properties: file containing workflow database connection configuration"
" - license.lic: file containing the Brainwave product license"
"<config name> is the name of the configuration (defined in a project .configuration file)"
"[SIMULATE] simulation mode nothing will be written in Database"
"[FORCE] Launch execution plan even if non validated timeslot has been found in database"
"-f <csv file path> Csv File containing list of account identifiers and repository codes, csv preferences must be the same as in the configuration file"
"-a <account identifier column name> Column name in csv file containing account identifiers"
"-r <repository code column name> Column name in csv file containing repository codes"
"[-f -a -r] options are mandatory only if you need to break the postponement of specific bad reconciliations, refer to the documentation for more details"
"<reference timeslot tag> is the tag (32 char max) to mark the timeslot as a reference one"

Command line example: igrc_batch demonstration /var/igrc/config default SIMULATE"
Another example: igrc_batch demonstration /var/igrc/config default"
```
#### Monitoring

In the X version, there are monitoring logs showing information about the resources used in the file `monitoring_<timeslot>.txt`. These logs are written regularly and the interval of time can be set with the following parameter, `-Dmonitoringinvertal=XXX`.The value must be set in milliseconds. The default value is every 10 seconds (10000ms).  

#### JStack
With the parameter `-Djstackenabled=true`, JStack thread dump can be written in logs with the following format, `jstack_N_<timeslot>.txt`. The last file written is named `jstack_<timeslot>.txt`.  
The parameter `-Djstackinterval=<time>`, can be used to set the jstack frequency.   
The value must be set in milliseconds. The default value is every hour (3600000ms).  
The parameter `-Djstackmaxfile=<number of file>` can be used to set the maximum number of file created. Only the most recent files are kept. The default value is 0, which means that every file created will be kept.  

#### Break Reconciliation

Please refer to the following page for more information on how to break reconciliations:

[Delete Reconciliations](../reconciliation/index#delete-account-reconciliation)

#### Restart

In some situations it can be useful to execute specific steps of an execution plan via command line (batch). This can be the case when issues occur during the batch execution of the execution plan such as disconnections to the data base.  

> [!warning] The following commands only work if:  
>
> 1. A single sandbox is present in the database or
> 2. An activated timeslot is present in the database

The Batch cmd and sh commands have been enhanced to accept a new option `-restart`. This allows the user to restart the execution plan at given step of the execution plan. The option takes a mandatory attribute:  

- `before-activation`: To re-execute all step starting from the activation of the timeslot (requires a minimum of a sandbox state timeslot)
- `after-activation`: To re-execute all post activation steps, just before the computation of active identities (requires a minimum an activate state timeslot)

> [!warning] When the option before-activation is used and if the current working timeslot is partially or completely activate it is reverted to a sandbox state before re-executing the activation.  

A command example  for `Windows`:  

```powershell  
.\igrc_batch.cmd myProject D:\igrc\properties\ dev_conf -restart before-activation
```

A command example for `Linux`:  

```sh  
./igrc_batch.sh myProject /opt/igrc/properties/ dev_conf -restart before-activation
```

### igrc_extract

"Usage: igrc_extract <project name> <config folder> <config name> [<silo name>]"
"<config folder> should contain these files:"
"- project.properties: file containing project configuration variables"
"- datasource.properties: file containing database connection configuration"
"- mail.properties: file containing mail server connection configuration"
"- license.zip: file containing the Brainwave product license"
"<config name> is the name of the configuration (defined in a project .configuration file)"

"Another example to lunch purge from configuration: igrc_purge demonstration /var/igrc/config default PURGE"
```

### igrc_setenv

To centralize the configuration of batch commands a file has been added: `igrc_setenv.cmd` or `igrc_setenv.sh`.  
This file is used to the configuration of the:  

- `JAVA_OPTS` for example the memory allocated to the batch scripts
 `IGRC_WORKSPACE` to declare the path to the workspace to be used by the batch scripts
- `USER_JAVA_HOME` to declare the path to the JAVA home folder to be used by the batch scripts

The following lines can be updated (`set ...`):  

```sh  
rem (Optional) Java runtime options used when any command is executed.
set JAVA_OPTS=-Xms256m -Xmx2g

rem (Optional) IGRC workspace path containing the project.
set IGRC_WORKSPACE=%IGRC_HOME%/workspace

rem (Optional) point to a specific Jdk/Jre home, otherwise the product will search in JAVA_HOME or JRE_HOME environment variable
