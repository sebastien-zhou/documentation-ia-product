# Introduction

You can perform the following customization via a custom CSS file:   

- Change the font style (family, size and weight) of the header title
- Change the font style (family, size and weight)  of the user name in the header
- Change the font style of the navigation menu items , in both normal and selected states.
- Change the global font used in the portal
- Change some style aspects ( font, background and text colors, border styles ) of various components displayed in the content area ( tables, combo box, labels, tabs, etc.)   

**Required skills**   

- Audit project configuration
- CSS syntax

# Custom CSS file syntax

Brainwave web portal internally uses a web framework known as **Eclipse RAP (Remote Application Platform** ).   
Eclipse RAP is an open-source project supported by the Eclipse foundation ([https://www.eclipse.org/rap/](https://www.eclipse.org/rap/)).   
Basically, Eclipse RAP leverages Eclipse **Java SWT** (Standard Widget Kit) coding to automatically produce state-of-the-art HTML5 web application that can be run on any browser.   
Like HTML applications, Eclipse RAP applications uses CSS files to control the appearance of widgets in the browser.   

However, these CSS files are not passed as is to the browser, they are processed on the server side to compute the actual appearance of widgets.    

Eclipse RAP CSS uses a specific syntax which closely resembles HTML CSS3 with the following similarities:   

- Element selectors  
 
```
Button {
   color: #000000;
   background-color: blue;
   font: bold 13px arial;
}
```
- Class selectors  

```
.nav {
   border: 1px solid gray;
}
```
- common set of css properties  
`color, background-color, font, border, background-image, opacity, etc`
- Pseudo classes:

```
Text:hover
Button:selected
```

and differences:   

- cascading classes are not supported   
`.nav .selected /*is not supported*/`
- special state syntax for SWT widget styles

```
Button [PUSH] {
   border-radius: 3px;
}
```

- sub-elements to control the appearance of widgets sub-elements  

```
Button-CheckIcon { }
Grid-GridLine { }
```

- Completely different set of elements that matches SWT standard widget classes rather than HTML standard elements    
`Button, Label, List, Menu, Text, Composite, Display, etc...`   
- **font** is supported , but not **font-family** , **font-size** and **font-weight** properties. Any change to a font must include the font family, size and style

```
Text {
  font: 12px roboto,sans-serif;
}
Text.important {
    font: bold 12px roboto,sans-serif;
}
```

# Using a custom CSS file in the web portal

To use a custom CSS file in the web application, do the following:    

- Check Use custom theme extension option
- Select `*.css` as file type, then select your custom css file to use
- Generate the web-portal so that the css file is included in the web app
- Redeploy the web app to the web server    

![Custom CSS file](../images/custom_css_default.png "Custom CSS file")   

# Fine tuning your custom CSS file  

It's unlikely that your custom css file will be satisfactory at the first deployment.    
So you will have try successive changes and verify their impact on the display until you are done.   

To fine tune your css file, do the following:   

- Check **Activate debug mode** in the **web portal** tab of the configuration
- Select the custom css file to use as described above. The initial content of the file does not matter
- Generate the web portal and deploy to the web server
- Open the web portal in your favorite browser and log in
- Notice that the main menu has an item "**Dev \> Reload theme files**"

![Reload theme files](../images/dev-relooad-theme.png "Reload theme files")   

- Each time you make a change to the css file (and save), select **Dev \> Reload theme files**  and the page will be reloaded with the new css values.
- If there are any errors in the css, a message box will be displayed.  
For example, there is a space between 24 and px

```
Label.header-title {
font: 24 px Broadway ;
}
``` 

![CSS errors](../images/2018-02-20_0238.png "CSS errors")   

- Once you are done with the CSS, and to make the changes permanent,    
you need to make **one last web portal generation and deployment** ( and turn off "Debug mode" by the way)
