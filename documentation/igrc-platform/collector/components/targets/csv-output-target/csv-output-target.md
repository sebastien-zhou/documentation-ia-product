# Usage

This **CSV Output** target component allows to write the result of a collect to a csv file, instead of writing to the database.   
A typical use is to process and pass data between different collectors that cannot communicate directly, on a distributed environment.   
It can also be used for debugging purposes to test the output of a collect without writing anything to the database.   
It is used internally by the Audit Log collector to write audit log data to a bulk file before sending them to the database.

# The properties Tab

## Target

the **Target** property tab allows to view/modify general parameters of the component:

- **Identifier** internal identifier of the component, useful in debug mode or for reading collect log files.
- **Display name**  for the **CSV Output target** , to be displayed in the collector editor.
- **Follow just one link**  option defines how multiple transition collectors are processed.  
If checked, only the first transition with an activation condition evaluated to true will be executed.  
If unchecked, all transitions with an activation condition evaluated to true will be executed.

## Description

The **Description** property Tab allows adding notes on the component, such as description of what the component is doing.

## File

The **File** property tab allows defining the path, name and CSV options of the output file

- **CSV File**  fully path and name of the csv output file. This path can contain javascript expressions enclosed in braces.   
The collector will try to create non-existing intermediate folders at runtime.
- **File encoding** for the CSV file. Use UTF-8 if no other constraints
- **Column separator**  between fields. You can use use comma, semi-colon, or tab as valid separators
- **Text field separator**  used to enclose file values for example if they contain special characters (column separator)
- **MultiValues separator** character used to separate values when outputing a multi-valued variable.  
You can leave this field blank if you only have single-valued variables to output.

## Columns

The **Columns** property tab allows to define the column names and content of the csv output file.

The columns are listed from left to right order in the csv file.

- **Add/Edit** buttons allows to add a column (attribute and name) and to modify an existing one (see below)
- **Delete** button allow to delete a column definition from the CSV file
- **Up / Down buttons** allow to reorder columns in the csv file.

### Adding/Editing a column

You can add any variable available at this point of the collect to the CSV file.

- **Attribute in collector** the variable to add. All variables than can be added can be selected from the right popup menu.
- **Column name or number** : name of the column in the header of the CSV file. It's preferable to not use spaces in the column name.

# Best practices

The CSV output target can be very useful in some situations, typically to transfer data between collectors that cannot communicate with each other.   
However , if the collectors are in the same project and run in the same sequence, it's preferable to make them communicate directly (as sub-collectors calls for example).

# Error handling

The collector will fail if no columns are defined or if the output CSV file cannot be created or written to.
