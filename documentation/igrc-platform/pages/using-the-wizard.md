IGRC Includes a wizard to easily create new pages. To use we can right click and create new file :   

![Wizard 1]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/igrc-platform/pages/images/0501.png "Wizard 1")   

The wizard will show up and ask us to define a name of the file   

![Wizard 2]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/igrc-platform/pages/images/0502.png "Wizard 2")   

In the next step we will define a page identifier, and a title ( The only required attribute ). We can also select a template (Blank page in the example):   

![Wizard 3]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/igrc-platform/pages/images/0503.png "Wizard 3")   

When we hit finish we will have a new page file created using the best practices for internationalisation and with comments to include the different blocks in the right places.   

![Wizard 4]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/igrc-platform/pages/images/0504.png "Wizard 4")   

Page is ready to be modified
